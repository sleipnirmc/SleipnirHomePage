# Member Products Display Fix

## Issue
Members were unable to see member-only products in the shop due to strict equality checking of the `members` field in the user document.

## Root Cause
The code was checking `userDoc.members === true` (strict boolean equality), but the `members` field in Firestore could be stored as:
- Boolean: `true`
- String: `'true'`
- Number: `1`
- String number: `'1'`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `shop.js` (lines 196-204)
```javascript
// Enhanced member status checking to handle different data formats
let isMember = false;
if (userDoc && userDoc.members !== undefined) {
    // Check for boolean true, string 'true', or any truthy value
    isMember = userDoc.members === true || 
               userDoc.members === 'true' || 
               userDoc.members === 1 ||
               userDoc.members === '1';
}
```

### 2. Updated `authentication.js` (lines 241-251)
```javascript
function isUserMember() {
    if (!userDocument || userDocument.members === undefined) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check for multiple possible formats
    return userDocument.members === true || 
           userDocument.members === 'true' || 
           userDocument.members === 1 ||
           userDocument.members === '1';
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Logging
Added detailed console logging to help diagnose member status issues:
- Member field value and type
- Products being filtered (total, members-only, public)
- Specific products hidden from non-members

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Check browser console for "Shop: Product filtering details" log
2. Verify `isMember: true` for member accounts
3. Confirm members-only products are visible

## Data Consistency Recommendation
Consider standardizing the `members` field to always be a boolean `true/false` when updating user records to avoid future type mismatches.
